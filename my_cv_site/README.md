# Personal CV Site

This is a small Flask application that renders my CV as a single-page website. It uses Bootstrap 5 for styling and keeps my private contact details hidden.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application with:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
```
